    # Rule

    **NB** : in your feature file. if you have `Scenario` / `Scenario Outline` not in rule.
    They should de ordered before `Rule`.

    For example, if you write this : 

    ~~~feature
    Feature: Run tests with Rule
        Rule: I've specific Scenario
            Scenario: I'm rule's scenario
                Given I use vitest-cucumber
                Then  It know I come from a Rule
        Scenario: I'm feature's scenario
            Given I use vitest-cucumber
            Then  It know I come from a Feature
    ~~~

    **vitest-cucumber** doesn't use indentation, is too complex for a little bring.

    So In this case *I'm feature's scenario* `Scenario` is added to your Rule.
    
    ## Rule example

    `Rule` is like a `Feature`, you can declare your scenarios and their steps.

    ~~~javascript
    describeFeature(feature, ({Rule}) => {
        Rule(`rule with scenarii`, ({RuleScenario, RuleScenarioOutline}) => {
            RuleScenario(`rule scenario`, ({Given, When, Then}) => {
                Given(``, () => {})
                When(``, () => {})
                Then(``, () => {})
            })
            RuleScenarioOutline(`rule scenario outline`, ({Given, When, Then, And}) => {
                Given(``, () => {})
                When(``, () => {})
                Then(``, () => {})
                And(``, () => {})
            })
        })
    })
    ~~~

    ## Hooks

    If you set hooks `BeforeEachScenario` and/or `AfterEachScenario` inside `describeFeature`.

    They will be used in your rule(s) scenario(s).
